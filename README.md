# Smart_Elderly_Home
This project aims to develop a smart home platform for assisting the elderly to control their smart device on one platform anywhere and anytime. Besides, the website version and mobile app version are developed via the home assistant. This platform connected all the installed smart devices and designed a user-friendly interface, including light control, window control, temperature control, kitchen safety detection, fall detection, etc. Therefore, this smart home platform supports mobility and is more convenient for elderly users.
